# Inheritance-of-HEB-in-wheat

## Background:

## Data availability:

All RNA-seq data were uploaded to [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under the BioProject ID XXXXXX.

## Methodology:

Scripts are organised by Methods sections as outlined in the manuscript in the [scripts](scripts/) folder.

All data (where possible) necessary for scripts to run is organised by Methods sections in the [data_tables](data_tables/) folder.

  ### 1. HEB analysis


  ### 2. Gene ontology term enrichment


  ### 3. Variant calling, genotyping and association between genotype and homoeolog expression

  
  ### 4. SNP genotyping of F6 lines for eQTL mapping


  ### 5. Quantification of gene expression levels and correction for batch effects


  ### 6. Detection of eQTL

## Figures:

The code for recreating figure panels along with ready to plot data is organised by figure numbers as stated in the manuscript, in the [figures](figures/) folder.
